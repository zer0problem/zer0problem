* forward+ for light culling to the forward pass
* orderered transparency
* backend of a node scripting system [explanation](/project7/update/2021/04/11/node-system.html)
* small parts of the frontend for our script system
* large parts of physx implementation
* multiple materials from the same model

What project 8 will bring is still in the future! I'm sure it will be neat.

There's also been 5 earlier projects that you can look at here.

Skills
-----------
Most comfortable in C++ and visual studio but not afraid to branch out as needed.
Experience in other programming languages allow me to quickly pick up new languages if needed.
Performance aware, knows how to use the cache and store data efficiently, when to move data and when you can skip moving it, both in small enclosed functions and when using and accessing larger systems.
Some experience with SIMD instructions for micro-optimizations.
I can read and understand C++ error messages.
