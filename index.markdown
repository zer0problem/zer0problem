Achievements
-----------
8 game projects in TGA.  
Made the game engine used in project 6 and onwards.

for project 6 it supported
* PBR rendering (see other things, everyone did this, nothing special)
* instancing
* deferred and forward rendering
* skeletal animations
* shadow mapping with directional lights [example](images/project6_shadows_deferred.png)
* background resource streaming
* projected decals [example](images/project6_decal_uneven_surface.webm)
* VFX Node System [example](images/project6_effect_editor.png) and [result](images/project6_effect_editor_result.webm)

for project 7 I added support for
* spot lights with cookies & shadows [example](images/project7_spotlight_shadow_and_cookie.webm)
* tiled shading with point lights
* orderered transparency
* backend of a node scripting system [explanation TODO](node_system)
* small parts of the frontend for our script system
* large parts of physx implementation
* multiple materials from the same model
* different rendering technique used per-material, forward or deferred

What project 8 will bring is still in the future! I'm sure it will be neat.

Skills
-----------
Most comfortable in C++ and visual studio but not afraid to branch out as needed.
Experience in other programming languages allow me to quickly pick up new languages if needed.
Performance aware, knows how to use the cache and store data efficiently, when to move data and when you can skip moving it, both in small enclosed functions and when using and accessing larger systems.
Some experience with SIMD instructions for micro-optimizations.
I can read and understand C++ error messages.
