Accomplishments
-----------
During my studies at [The Game Assembly](https://www.thegameassembly.com/) as a game programmer I've been a part of 7 game projects in so far. Here I've been working together with other students, game programmers, level designers and graphical artists, usually it's been in groups of about 11-13 people.  
Lately I've been working on the game engine used in project 6 and subsequent projects.

for [project 7](/project/7/) I added support for
* spot lights with cookies & shadows <a class="link" href="/images/project7_spotlight_shadow_and_cookie.gif">example<img class="preview" src="/images/project7_spotlight_shadow_and_cookie.gif"></a>
* tiled deferred shading with point lights [explanation](/project7/update/2021/04/07/project7-point-lights.html)
* forward+ for light culling to the forward pass
* ordered transparency
* backend of a node scripting system [explanation](/project7/update/2021/04/11/node-system.html)
* small parts of the front end for our script system
* large parts of physx implementation
* multiple materials from the same model
* different rendering technique used per-material, forward or deferred

for [project 6](/project/6/) it supported
* PBR rendering (everyone did this, nothing special)
* instancing
* deferred and forward rendering
* skeletal animations
* shadow mapping with directional lights <a class="link" href="/images/project6_shadows_deferred.png">example<img class="preview" src="/images/project6_shadows_deferred.png"></a> 
* background resource streaming
* projected decals <a class="link" href="/images/project6_decal_uneven_surface.gif">example<img class="preview" src="/images/project6_decal_uneven_surface.gif"></a>
* VFX Node System <a class="link" href="/images/project6_effect_editor.png">example<img class="preview" src="/images/project6_effect_editor.png"></a> and <a class="link" href="/images/project6_effect_editor_result.gif">result<img class="preview" src="/images/project6_effect_editor_result.gif"></a>

We still have one more project left to complete, what it will bring is still in the future! I'm sure it will be neat.

There's also been 5 earlier projects that you can look at here.

Skills
-----------
I'm most comfortable in C++ and visual studio but not afraid to branch out as needed.  
Experience in other programming languages allow me to quickly pick up new languages if needed.  
Performance aware, knows how to use the cache and store data efficiently, when to move data and when you can skip moving it, both in small enclosed functions and when using and accessing larger systems.  
Some experience with SIMD instructions for micro-optimizations.  
I can read and understand C++ error messages.
