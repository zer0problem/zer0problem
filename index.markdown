Accomplishments
-----------
During my time at Thunderful Games I have worked on different projects at different phases in development, including porting Wavetale to PC and consoles such as PS4 and Nintendo Switch.

During my studies at [The Game Assembly](https://www.thegameassembly.com/) as a game programmer I were a part of 8 game projects. There I worked together with other students, game programmers, level designers and graphical artists, usually it's been in groups of about 11-13 people.  
During the final year I've worked on the game engine used in project 6 and subsequent projects.

for project 8 I added support for
* contact shadows
* tone mapping
* wind shader

but most of my time in project 8 was spent on optimizing performance, fixing issues and improving the workflow by updating our debugging tools.

for [project 7](/project/7/) I added support for
* spot lights with cookies & shadows <a class="link" href="/images/project7_spotlight_shadow_and_cookie.gif">example<img class="preview" src="/images/project7_spotlight_shadow_and_cookie.gif"></a>
* tiled deferred shading with point lights [explanation](/project7/update/2021/04/07/project7-point-lights.html)
* forward+ for light culling to the forward pass
* ordered transparency
* backend of a node scripting system [explanation](/project7/update/2021/04/11/node-system.html)
* small parts of the front end for our script system
* large parts of physx implementation
* multiple materials from the same model
* different rendering technique used per-material, forward or deferred

for [project 6](/project/6/) it supported
* PBR rendering (everyone did this, nothing special)
* instancing
* deferred and forward rendering
* skeletal animations
* shadow mapping with directional lights <a class="link" href="/images/project6_shadows_deferred.png">example<img class="preview" src="/images/project6_shadows_deferred.png"></a> 
* background resource streaming
* projected decals <a class="link" href="/images/project6_decal_uneven_surface.gif">example<img class="preview" src="/images/project6_decal_uneven_surface.gif"></a>
* VFX Node System <a class="link" href="/images/project6_effect_editor.png">example<img class="preview" src="/images/project6_effect_editor.png"></a> and <a class="link" href="/images/project6_effect_editor_result.gif">result<img class="preview" src="/images/project6_effect_editor_result.gif"></a>

There's also been 5 earlier projects that you can look at here.

Skills
-----------
I have most recenly worked in Unity and C# but I am also comfortable with C++ and not afraid to learn new things.  
Experience in other programming languages allow me to quickly pick up new languages if needed.  
Performance aware, knows how to use the cache and store data efficiently, when to move data and when you can skip moving it, both in small enclosed functions and when using and accessing larger systems.  
Some experience with SIMD instructions for micro-optimizations.
