Contributions to this project
-----------
Besides the engine([RiktigMotor](/riktig_motor/)) things I've also worked on
* Level loading
1. models
2. lights
3. physics objects
4. node scripts w/ initialization
* Player movement
* Player weapons abilities
* Player interactions
* Interactable doors (through the node editor)
* Node script templates for artists/designers
* Presenting our tools for the artists/designers

What I learned
-----------
This project, for me, has been about scaling the engine for larger projects. Expanding on the existing engine, I learned a lot about expanding existing code and making code that would be sustainable through several projects.

I've been reading about different optimizations and libraries, such as [tiled rendering](https://tommi-israelsson.se/project7/update/2021/04/07/project7-point-lights.html) and nvidias physx framework for the physics of the game.
