This was the project I started with the engine [RiktigMotor](/riktig_motor/) this is not the page where I go into those details.  
Besides the engine and it's features I also worked on an editor for visual effects, used for pretty much every torch,fire and ability effects in the game. <a class="link" href="/images/project6_effect_editor.png">example<img class="preview" src="/images/project6_effect_editor.png"></a> and <a class="link" href="/images/project6_effect_editor_result.gif">result<img class="preview" src="/images/project6_effect_editor_result.gif"></a>  
I also worked on all the player abilities and interactions.  

This project was mostly the engine for me, check that out instead.
