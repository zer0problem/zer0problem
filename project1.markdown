Major tasks for this project
-----------
I was mainly tasked with SVN Support, as the only member that had earlier experience with version control systems, most of my early time I spent helping level designers and graphical artists with syncing everything, there was a recurring problem of the meta files from unity not syncing correctly resulting in missing meshes.  
This happened when someone added a file without importing it to unity, causing everyone elses unity to import it and assign it a GUID, that then conflicted between different workstations, as a workaround I opened level designers files and and replaced the faulty GUID with the correct ones from the SVN server.  

I was also responsible for large parts of the final player movement and feedback, working closely with artists to make sure it all looked like they envisioned.
